# vercel-ai-examples

A collection of AI First example projects in TypeScript built with the Vercel AI stack. This repository documents my journey of building AI-powered applications and their key building blocks.

It includes a set of Playground apps to research and play with different capabilities and a set of specialized apps that are purpose built for a specific domain

- Learn the Vercel stack
  - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
  - [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai)
  - [Turbo](https://turbo.build)
- Explore Generative AI capabilities
  - Text Generation
  - Text Classification
  - Text Sentiment Analysis
  - Structured Output
  - Code Generation
  - Image Generation
  - Image Classification
  - Image Captioning
- Learn Generative AI building blocks
  - LLMs: Local and hosted
  - Prompt Engineering: Single shot and multi-shot
  - Prompt chaining: Chaining prompts for better results
  - Memory: Long term memory
  - RAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation
  - Agents: AI powered agent workflows
  - Human in the loop: AI powered workflows with human interaction
- Build complete AI-powered applications
  - How to build AI-powered applications with Vercel AI
  - How applications are built differently with AI at the core

## Introduction

Learn how to build complete AI-powered applications with Vercel AI by following the examples in this repository. All of these examples can be run locally and deployed to Vercel and have been verified to work with open source models both locally and in the cloud.

## Features

- **AI First**: Built with AI at the core
- **Full UI**: Each example has a full UI
- **Complete Applications**: A collection of complete AI-powered applications
- **TypeScript**: Written in TypeScript
- **Next.js**: Built with Next.js

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd vercel-ai-examples
npm install
```

Then, you can run the example applications using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.
